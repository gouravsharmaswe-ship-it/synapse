# Synapse WebSocket Protocol Specification

Synapse uses a JSON-based real-time protocol over standard WebSockets. All frames are UTF-8 encoded JSON text frames.

## 2. Client-to-Server Messages

Every message sent by the client must have a type field `"t"`.

| Message Type (`t`) | Required Fields | Optional Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `join` | `room` (string, 1-32 chars) | `name` (string, max 24), `clientId` (string) | Sent immediately after socket opens. `clientId` is preserved across reconnects. |
| `set` | `key` (string, 1-64 chars) | `value` (JSON serializable, max 10KB) | Set or update a shared key. Omit `value` to delete key. |
| `cursor` | `x` (number, 0.0-1.0), `y` (number, 0.0-1.0) | - | Send normalized viewport mouse coordinates (~30fps max). |
| `ping` | - | - | Heartbeat frame to ensure socket remains open through proxies. |

## 3. Server-to-Client Messages

| Message Type (`t`) | Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `welcome` | `id`, `room`, `version`, `state`, `peers` | Confirmation of join. Contains full shared state snapshot and online peer list. |
| `state` | `key`, `value`, `by`, `v` | Broadcast when any peer updates a key. `by` contains peer ID; `v` is the room version. |
| `peer-join` | `peer: { id, name, color }` | Broadcast when a new peer enters the room. |
| `peer-leave` | `id` | Broadcast when a peer disconnects or times out. |
| `cursor` | `id`, `x`, `y` | Broadcast peer cursor coordinates (sent to other peers in room only). |
| `pong` | - | Server heartbeat reply. |
| `error` | `code`, `message` | Returned on invalid requests without crashing the server. |

## 4. Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| `bad_json` | Inbound payload could not be parsed as JSON. |
| `bad_message` | Inbound object is missing required `"t"` type property. |
| `bad_room` | Room name does not match `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,32}$`. |
| `not_joined` | Attempted to mutate state or send cursor before joining a room. |
| `already_joined` | Attempted to send a second `join` message on an existing connection. |
| `room_full` | Room has reached maximum allowed concurrent peers (25). |
| `bad_key` | Key string is empty or exceeds 64 characters. |
| `too_big` | Payload value exceeds 10,000 serialized JSON characters. |
| `too_many_keys` | Room has reached maximum stored keys (100). |
| `rate_limited` | Exceeded rate limits (30 updates/sec for state, 60 updates/sec for cursor). |
| `unknown_type` | Unrecognized message type. |

## 5. Security & Resource Limits

- **Room Isolation**: Each room maintains independent key-value state and peer lists. Data never leaks across rooms.
- **Max Payload Size**: 16 KB per WebSocket frame.
- **Empty Room TTL**: Empty rooms are garbage collected after 10 minutes of inactivity.
- **Heartbeat & Dead Peer Detection**: Ping sweep every 30 seconds terminates unacknowledged sockets.
